1. Read in data and preprocess
  1a. preprocess <- function(bike_data.csv), input is a csv file.
      outputs are the dataframe containing the data. This function
      will read in the data and clean data (remove any NAs, etc.)
2. Estimate rates of arrival
  2a. estimated_arrival_rates <- function(data), input is a cleaned dataframe
      representing the bike data.
      Output is a dataframe containing the computed estimated arrival rates for 
      each pair of stations and each hour given the input data
3. Simulate a day
  3a. simulate_day <- function(estimated_rates), input is a dataframe that
      contains the estimated arrival rates between two stations at any hour. 
      Output is a dataframe that simulates trips between stations per hour for 
      a single day. We use this function to simulate when people are at any
      station at any hour and where they are going in order to help us 
      determine where to place bikes to optimize trips. This function uses
      the estimated arrival rates to come up with the simulated trips.
4. Optimize placement
  4a. placement <- function(num_bikes, simulated_day_data), inputs include an
      interger (num_bikes) that represent the total number of bikes to be
      distributed across the different stations, and the simulated_data that
      will be analyzed to determine where to put bikes. Output is a
      dataframe that contains the number of bikes that should be placed at each
      station (at the start of the day, so at hour 0) to optimize the number 
      of trips between any two staions at any given hour.
      
data -> preprocess() -> estimated_arrival_rates() -> simulate_day() ->
optimize_placement()

Final output returns a table with number of bikes to be placed at each station
at the beginning of the day. We will also output a heatmap figure to show which
pair of stations are the most popular (most trips) for a given hour or across
the whole day to motivate our placement.
